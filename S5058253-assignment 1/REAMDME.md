## General Info 
The assignment is to control a holonomic robot in 2d space 
with a simple 2d simulator.

## Algorithm
1. Set a random target in the interval [-6.0, 6.0]
2. Check the distance between target and robot position
3. IF distance is larger than 0.1 
	-> update x,y speed value 
	-> Go to step 2.
4. Else -> Go to step 1.

## Content of Package
### Node
1. First node:	(assignment1)
* ROS publisher: publishing the robot speed
* ROS subscriber: subscribe for robot position
* ROS client: receiving a random target
2. Second node: (assignment1_srv)
* ROS server: Service Server replys to the client with a random target

### Custom Service
1. Random_Target service: return two random positions between [-6.0, 6.0]

## How to run the code
1. After git clone, move repository to /home/
2. Add the line 'source /home/juri-rose-ws/devel/setup.bash' in your .bashrc file.
3. Change the directory to the workspace /home/juri-rose-ws/
4. Build the packages 'catkin_make'
5. Refresh 'rospack profile'
6. Run the simulator
* $ roscore &
* $ rosrun stage_ros stageros $(rospack find assignment1)/world/exercise.world

7. Run the service node
* $ rosrun assignment1_srv assignment1_srv

8. Run the First node 
* $ rosrun assignment1 assignment1
